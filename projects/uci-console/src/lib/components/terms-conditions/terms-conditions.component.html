                            experience on DIKSHA as usage of DIKSHA sets the cookies again.
                            Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings as well.
                            Doing so, will mean that certain things on DIKSHA will not
                            function properly. For eg., images/plugins may take a long time to
                            load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after
                            login.

                    <label class="tagLine"><em>( Last updated on <b>28-04-2021</b> )</em></label>
                    <p>
                        This Content Policy sets out the guidelines for content to be followed
                        on DIKSHA. The DIKSHA Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates
                        one of the intentions of DIKSHA - to create a common repository of open
                        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This
                        Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The content creation and curation process on DIKSHA is envisaged to be
                        an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages
                        participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
                        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of
                        centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community
                        to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators,
                        being the custodians of DIKSHA, frame the guidelines and curation rules,
                        and delegate the authority to curate to the community. This creates a
                        platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of
                        content is ensured by the federated process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply
                        with respect to Content on DIKSHA. These rules are to be taken seriously
                        as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are
                        requested not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and
                        respect the spirit in which they have been created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules
                        on appropriateness, accuracy, intellectual property rights and licensing
                        that govern Content on DIKSHA.
