                            uses cookies. Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot only uses session cookies, none of the other
                            types of cookies. Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot session cookies are used to store URLs in
                            order to better redirect users to the right pages. For example,
                            when a User signs-in to Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot from the courses page, they'll
                            need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of
                            sign-in for a cleaner user experience. Session cookies are also
                            used to store whether to use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to
                            pull images, plugins and other assets that are shown on the user
                            interface. This is to enable faster loading of the pages the User
                            interacts with. No personal information, or user preferences are

                            experience on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot as usage of Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot sets the cookies again.

                            Doing so, will mean that certain things on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot will not
                            function properly. For eg., images/plugins may take a long time to
                            load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after
                            login.

                        This Content Policy sets out the guidelines for content to be followed
                        on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot. The Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates
                        one of the intentions of Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot - to create a common repository of open
                        education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This
                        Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.

                    <p>
                        The content creation and curation process on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot is envisaged to be
                        an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages
                        participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
                        platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of
                        centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community
                        to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators,
                        being the custodians of Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot, frame the guidelines and curation rules,
                        and delegate the authority to curate to the community. This creates a
                        platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of
                        content is ensured by the federated process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply
                        with respect to Content on Nipun Lakshya App Chatbot. These rules are to be taken seriously
                        as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are
                        requested not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and
                        respect the spirit in which they have been created.
